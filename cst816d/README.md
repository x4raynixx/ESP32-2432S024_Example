CST816D
=======

This is an Arduino library for the CST816D touchscreen IC. It is used for example on the [RP2350-Touch-LCD-2](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RP2350-Touch-LCD-2) board from Waveshare. By the way, the code from this library is heavily inspired by the example provided by Waveshare. I've just "Arduinified" it.
